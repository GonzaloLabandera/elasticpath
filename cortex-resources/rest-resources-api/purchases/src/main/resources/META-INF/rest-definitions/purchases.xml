####Entry Point: /purchases/{scope}

A purchase is a receipt of an executed order. A Purchase lists the order's total cost, purchase date, purchase status
(COMPLETE or FAILED), tax paid, paymentmeans, which lists the billing and shipping details as well as
customer's [paymentmethods][paymentmethods], and line items, which are lists of the [items][items] the customer
purchased.

Each time customers make successful purchases, Cortex API records them in its database. Using the purchases resource,
client developers can retrieve the customer's purchase history, which allows customers to inspect their previous purchases,
check for correctness, and track the purchase's status. Cortex API records each successful purchase and the last failed
purchase. Cortex API does not track each failed purchase, it only records the last failed purchase. Once the purchase
completes, the failed purchase is removed from the record and a successful purchase is recorded.
