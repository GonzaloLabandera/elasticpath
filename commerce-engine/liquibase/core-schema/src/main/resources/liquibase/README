Q: How do I add my changeSet to the changeLog?

A: Find the "core-changelog-VERSION.xml" file (where VERSION is the
version you're working on), and add your changeSet to the bottom.  
NEVER modify a changeSet once it has been committed; always create a new
changeSet when making a new change.

	- Use "elasticpath" as the author.
	- Use the JIRA issue appended with a dot an incrementing number as the id. 
		Ex.  For the first changeSet for JIRA issue BN-64, use: id="BN-64.1"
	  		 For the second changeSet for JIRA issue BN-64, use: id="BN-64.2"
	  		 .. Etc.
			 
A full list of syntax for defining database changes in Liquibase ChangeSets can 
be found in the Liquibase Manual here: http://www.liquibase.org/manual/refactoring_commands

Q: What do I do if I can't find a "core-changelog-VERSION.xml" file?

A: Create a new one.  Use the header from "core-changelog-6.4.xml" and change:

   1. logicalFilePath
   2. remove existing changeLogs :-) (please leave the comments, add to them as you need!)
   3. Add to source control.
   4. Add an <include/> to the bottom of core-changelog-master.xml

core-changelog-master.xml
-------------------------

This file has all the Liquibase changes for core.  To make it maintainable
it has an include for each version.
