  <!--
     NOTE: EP has a com.elasticpath.test.persister package which shouldn't exist.  In there is a TestApplicationContext.useDb which makes
     a number of assumptions about the system around it which it shouldn't.  Previously it would lookup and execute schema.sql and base-insert.sql on
     a per-database-type lookup. It would use these to "recreate" the database.
    -->
  <!--
     As a work around until we remove com.elasticpath.test.persister, the lookup-and-execute has been replaced by a call to an application
     context to create a bean named "liquibaseCoreSchemaInitializerForTestApplication". You do not want to use this bean.  It is an unsupported
     workaround. -->
  <!--
     If you are extending the schema, please override the bean in some other XML file and ensure it makes it into the classpath of the TestApplicationContext.
    -->
  <!-- Do not copy this pattern unless you understand why it's here. -->
