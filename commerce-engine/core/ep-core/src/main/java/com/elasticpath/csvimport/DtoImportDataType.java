/**
 * <p>Interface for {@code ImportDataType}s that represent DTO objects, which allows the
 * ImportDataType to actually return a prototype bean of the data type which is being imported
 * so that it can be populated by an {@code CsvImportFieldObjectMapper}. This interface was
 * created to extend the ImportDataType interface when an enhanced, modular CSV import structure
 * was designed.</p>
 * <p>The original CSV import architecture
 * relied on the ImportDataType implementations to perform many duties, including:
 * defining {@code ImportField}s, defining the Spring identifier of the bean that would run import
 * jobs for the ImportDataType being described, running the logic associated with deleting,
 * creating, and saving the data type (in some cases). Instantiation of a new prototype bean
 * was left to a special implementation of {@code ImportJobRunner} for that bean.</p>
 * <p>This enhanced implementation now has a more generic {@code ImportJobRunner} but each
 * bean being imported specifies its own {@code CsvImportFieldDtoMapper}, which is responsible for
 * mapping CSV rows (string arrays) into object prototype beans which are assumed to be simple
 * DTO objects. However, it has a reference to an ImportDataType but needs to instantiate the prototype
 * bean that is to be populated from the CSV row. Since that bean cannot be obtained by Spring injection
 * (ImportService already retrieves it from the {@code PrototypeBeanFactory} then it must be provided
 * by the ImportDataType.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the bean being imported
