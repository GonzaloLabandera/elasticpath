 * Traverses a tree of {@code TreeNode} elements using pre-order traversal - the node is visited and then

 * to create destination node which is passed into the {@code processNode} method for each of the current node's
 * children. <br/>

 * Note that this algorithm is designed with copying trees in mind. It is possible this is not a generic traverser
 * but is a copy traverser instead.
