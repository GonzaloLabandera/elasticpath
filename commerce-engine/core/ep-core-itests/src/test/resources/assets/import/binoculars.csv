"118708"|10010018|"The new Magellan WP I series of binoculars is a high-performance, compact, easy-to-use, water-proof, fog-proof, and dirt-proof line built for relentless visual performance in severe outdoor conditions. The binoculars come in two magnifications, 8x25 and 10x25, and combine superior visual performance with minimal size and weight, making them a must have item for any outdoor enthusiast.    There is definitely no trade-off between image quality and durability with the Magellan series, as all lenses and prisms are fully multi-coated for maximum brightness and contrast, and high refractive index BaK4 prisms assure bright, crisp, edge-to-edge imaging. The Magellan WP I series of binoculars offer superior eye protection with Olympus special optical materials used to reduce the transmission of harmful UV rays. A built-in dioptric correction that adjusts to each user's individual eyesight ensures that viewers will always see action clearly. The Magellan WP I binoculars offer long eye relief, which refers to the maximum distance from the eyepiece lens at which the entire image can be seen. The high number ensures that users will be able to see the entire image through the binoculars even with glasses on.     The Magellan WP I binoculars are extremely compact in size, yet durable enough to withstand the elements and the needs of mountain-climbers and water-sport enthusiasts alike. The WP I series are lighter, smaller, and therefore easier to carry than the original Magellan EXWP I series, making them ideal for mountaineering, kayaking, and other outdoor activities where gear must be kept to a minimum.    The new Magellan WP I series are fully water-proof to a depth of one meter, perfect for use during any outdoor, on-water endeavors. The binoculars' hermetically sealed and nitrogen gas-filled lens system assures waterproof, fog-proof and dirt-proof performance under extreme weather conditions, and prevents mold from growing during long-term storage."|""|"Olympus Magellan binoculars 10 x 25 WP I"|"Olympus Magellan binoculars 10 x 25 WP I"|"17F953AB-821C-4B94-AC03-27058CB7770F.jpg"|90000014|"F00011"|"254"|""|"Olympus Magellan binoculars 10 x 25 WP I"|"Olympus Magellan binoculars 10 x 25 WP I"|"Olympus Magellan Binoculars"|"Olympus Magellan Jumelles"|"Buy the Olympus Magellan Binoculars 10 x 25 : The new Magellan WP I series of binoculars is a high-performance, compact, easy-to-use, water-proof, fog-proof, and dirt-proof line built for relentless v"|"Achetez le Olympus Magellan Jumelles 10 x 25 : "|"4.5"|""|"1.7"|"12.2"|""|""|"Olympus Magellan"|""|"16"|""|""|"10"|"25"|"Roof"|"Waterproof"|"Waterproof"|"Binoculars"|"Jumelles"|"Limited lifetime warranty"|"Garantie limitée à vie"|"GOODS"|2|"Wed Mar 16 15:49:37 2008"|AVAILABLE_WHEN_IN_STOCK|0|0

"8596-117"|10010022|"Minolta's Standard EZ Zoom binoculars include many of the high-performance features found on expensive binoculars, but for a fraction of the cost. Powerful zoom magnifications, bright and comfortable viewing, high-quality optics, diopter adjustment, and center wheel focusing makes Minolta Standard EZ Zoom binoculars the perfect choice for value-conscious consumers who want versatility and high power.    For a broad, powerful magnification range and high versatility, Standard EZ Zoom binoculars feature a convenient zoom lever that increases or decreases the magnification power. The user can scan a wide panoramic view at low power, then quickly zoom in on an object of interest. This makes EZ Zoom binoculars well suited for a variety of activities ranging from bird watching to sporting events. Like all Minolta EZ binoculars, the Standard EZ Zoom models use high-quality optics and BK7 prisms for bright and clear viewing with sharp, high-contrast images. The wide, light-gathering front (objective) lenses create large exit pupil diameters and a high brightness index, for an exceptionally clear image even under dimly-lit conditions. Diopter adjustment feature allows the user to fine-tune the binoculars to his or her own eyesight requirements. Diopter adjustment is independent of focusing, and needs to be set only once for the user. For comfortable handling in any situation, Minolta Standard EZ Zoom binoculars feature a lightweight, durable design with ergonomic handgrips. The grips are rubber coated to provide a sure hold. The large, knurled focusing wheel can be operated easily with either hand, and allows the user to quickly zero in on a subject or track moving objects effortlessly. Center-wheel focusing is quick and smooth even when wearing gloves."|"Minolta développe et fabrique des solutions d'imagerie destinées aux applications les plus exigeantes.
