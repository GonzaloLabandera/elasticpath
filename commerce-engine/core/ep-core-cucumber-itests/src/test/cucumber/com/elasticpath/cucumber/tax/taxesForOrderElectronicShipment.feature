Feature: taxesForOrderElectronicShipmentCancellation

As Finance, when an electronic shipment is placed, I do not want to see any tax entries for shipping.

Background: 

Given a store with an [exclusive] tax jurisdiction of [CA]
	And with tax rates of
		| taxName	| taxRate	| taxRegion	|
		| PST		| 7			| BC		|
		| GST		| 5			| CA		|

	And with products of
		| skuCode	| price		| type		|
		| GC-100 	| 100.00	| digital	|

	And with a default customer

Scenario: Tax Calculation for Electronic Shipment

When the customer purchases these items
		| quantity | skuCode	|
		| 1		   | GC-100		|

Then I expect that the tax journal should have purchase entries
		| journalType | transactionType | itemCode  | itemAmount | taxName | taxCode  | taxAmount | taxRate | taxJurisdiction | taxRegion |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | GC-100 	| 100.00	 | PST	   | GOODS	  | 7.00	  | 0.07 	| CA			  | BC		  |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | GC-100 	| 100.00	 | GST	   | GOODS	  | 5.00	  | 0.05    | CA			  | CA		  |
