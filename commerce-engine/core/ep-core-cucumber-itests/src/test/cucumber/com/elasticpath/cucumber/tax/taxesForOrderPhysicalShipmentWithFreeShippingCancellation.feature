Feature: taxesForOrderPhysicalShipmentWithFreeShippingCancellation

As Finance, when a physical order shipment has free shipping I want to record shipping taxes for purchases and cancellations, 
so I can differentiate between a zero-valued tax assessment and a lack of a tax assessment.

Background: 

Given a store with an [exclusive] tax jurisdiction of [CA]
	And with tax rates of
		| taxName	| taxRate	| taxRegion	|
		| PST		| 7			| BC		|
		| GST		| 5			| CA		|

	And with shipping regions of
		| region	| regionString	|
		| Canada	| [CA(BC)]		|

	And with shipping service levels of
		| region	| sslName			| price	|
		| Canada	| Free Shipping		| 0.00	|

	And with products of
		| skuCode	| price		| type		|
		| ETX-105PE	| 599.00	| physical	|

	And with a default customer



Scenario: Tax Calculation for Physical Order Shipment with Free Shipping

Given the customer's shipping address is in
		| subCountry | country |
		| BC		 | CA	   |
	
	And the customer shipping method is [Free Shipping]

When the customer purchases these items
		| quantity | skuCode   |
		| 1		   | ETX-105PE |

Then I expect that the tax journal should have purchase entries
		| journalType | transactionType | itemCode  | itemAmount | taxName | taxCode  | taxAmount	| taxRate | taxJurisdiction | taxRegion	  |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | PST	   | GOODS	  | 41.93		| 0.07    | CA				| BC		  |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | GST	   | GOODS	  | 29.95		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		  |	
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 0.00		 | PST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.07    | CA				| BC		  |	
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 0.00		 | GST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		  |	



Scenario: Tax Calculation for Physical Order Shipment Cancellation with Free Shipping

Given the customer's shipping address is in
		| subCountry | country |
		| BC		 | CA	   |
	
	And the customer shipping method is [Free Shipping]

	And the customer purchases these items
		| quantity | skuCode   |
		| 1		   | ETX-105PE |

When the order physical shipment is canceled

Then I expect that the tax journal should have purchase entries and reversal entries at the corresponding tax rates
		| journalType | transactionType | itemCode  | itemAmount | taxName | taxCode  | taxAmount	| taxRate | taxJurisdiction | taxRegion	  |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | PST	   | GOODS	  | 41.93		| 0.07    | CA				| BC		  |

		| reversal	  | Order Cancel	| SHIPPING	| 0.00		 | GST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		  |
