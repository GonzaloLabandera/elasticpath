Feature: taxesForOrderPhysicalShipmentWithZeroTaxCancellation

As Finance, when a tax rate is zero I want to record physical shipping taxes for purchases and cancellations, 
so I can differentiate between a zero-valued tax assessment and a lack of a tax assessment.

Background: 

Given a store with an [exclusive] tax jurisdiction of [CA]
	And with tax rates of
		| taxName	| taxRate	| taxRegion	|
		| PST		| 0			| AB		|
		| GST		| 5			| CA		|

	And with shipping regions of
		| region	| regionString	|
		| Canada	| [CA(AB)]		|

	And with shipping service levels of
		| region	| sslName			| price	|
		| Canada	| 2 Business Days	| 7.00  |

	And with products of
		| skuCode	| price		| type		|
		| ETX-105PE	| 599.00	| physical	|

	And with a default customer



Scenario: Tax Calculation for Order Shipment with Zero Tax

Given the customer's shipping address is in
		| subCountry | country |
		| AB		 | CA	   |
	
	And the customer shipping method is [2 Business Days]

When the customer purchases these items
		| quantity | skuCode   |
		| 1		   | ETX-105PE |

Then I expect that the tax journal should have purchase entries
		| journalType | transactionType | itemCode  | itemAmount | taxName | taxCode  | taxAmount	| taxRate | taxJurisdiction | taxRegion |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | PST	   | GOODS	  | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA			  | AB		  |
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | GST	   | GOODS	  | 29.95		| 0.05    | CA			  | CA		  |	
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 7.00		 | PST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA			  | AB		  |	
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 7.00		 | GST	   | SHIPPING | 0.35		| 0.05    | CA			  | CA		  |	



Scenario: Tax Calculation for Order Shipment Cancellation with Zero Tax

Given the customer's shipping address is in
		| subCountry | country |
		| AB		 | CA	   |
	
	And the customer shipping method is [2 Business Days]

	And the customer purchases these items
		| quantity | skuCode   |
		| 1		   | ETX-105PE |

When the order physical shipment is canceled

Then I expect that the tax journal should have purchase entries and reversal entries at the corresponding tax rates
		| journalType | transactionType | itemCode  | itemAmount | taxName | taxCode  | taxAmount	| taxRate | taxJurisdiction	| taxRegion	|
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | PST	   | GOODS	  | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA				| AB		|
		| purchase	  | Order		    | ETX-105PE | 599.00	 | GST	   | GOODS	  | 29.95		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		|
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 7.00		 | PST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA				| AB		|
		| purchase	  | Order			| SHIPPING	| 7.00		 | GST	   | SHIPPING | 0.35		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		|
		| reversal	  | Order Cancel	| ETX-105PE | -599.00	 | PST     | GOODS	  | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA				| AB		|
		| reversal	  | Order Cancel	| ETX-105PE | -599.00	 | GST     | GOODS	  | -29.95		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		|
		| reversal	  | Order Cancel	| SHIPPING	| -7.00		 | PST	   | SHIPPING | 0.00		| 0.00    | CA				| AB		|
		| reversal	  | Order Cancel	| SHIPPING	| -7.00		 | GST	   | SHIPPING | -0.35		| 0.05    | CA				| CA		|
