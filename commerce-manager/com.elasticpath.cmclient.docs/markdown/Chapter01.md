# Chapter 1: Introduction to Elastic Path Commerce Administration

Elastic Path Commerce is administered using a web browser. A separate URL is used to connect to each Elastic Path Commerce environment. For example, Test, Authoring, and Live environments.

Multiple user roles are supported by Elastic Path Commerce, including store and catalog managers, customer support representatives, and commerce administrators.

The features that are available depend on a user's role and permissions. Features that are not available are either disabled or completely hidden. As a result, the screen shots in this guide may not exactly match those that the users see.
