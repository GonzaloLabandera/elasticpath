### Account Locking after Failed Login

By default, if you are unable to log in to Elastic Path Commerce after six attempts, your account gets locked. If this occurs, you must ask an Elastic Path Commerce user with administrator privileges to unlock it. When your account is unlocked, your password is reset and you will receive an e-mail containing the new password. You will be able to log in with this password one time only and must change it immediately after logging in.
