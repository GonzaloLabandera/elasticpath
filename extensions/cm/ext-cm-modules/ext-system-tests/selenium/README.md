* -Dfailsafe.fork.count="1" - This is the number of parallel tests at the same time. Default is 1 and can be changed to other values depending on number of TestsIT classes.
* -Premote -Dremote.web.driver.url="<REMOTE DRIVER IP>" - The "remote" triggers tests to be executed using remote VM. The "remote.web.driver.url" specifies the URL of the remote VM. e.g. "http://10.10.2.113:4444/wd/hub"
