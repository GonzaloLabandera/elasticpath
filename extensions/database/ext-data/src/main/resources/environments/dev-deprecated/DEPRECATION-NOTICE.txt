Deprecation notice
------------------

The use of the "dev" environment name has been discontinued within Elastic Path because it is does
not accurately describe the environment's role within the development infrastructure.

The following names are used instead:
* ci
* qa
* perf
* stage

There is no problem if project teams want to continue using the "dev" environment name, as there is no
restriction to environment names.
