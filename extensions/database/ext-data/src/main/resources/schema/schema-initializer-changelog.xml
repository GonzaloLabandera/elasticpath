		Now include any schema customizations made to the EP database that exist at the start of this project.
		These will only be applied when creating a brand new EP database and not when updating an existing EP database
		(since it should already contain those customizations from a previous phase).
		Any other schema customizations made during this project that needs to be applied to existing EP databases should be made under the ext-data project, and not here.
		Those customizations will then be applied during the update-db phase the changes in the included file below will not.
